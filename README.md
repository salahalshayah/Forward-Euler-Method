# Forward-Euler-Method
This repository has the forward Euler method in CLI, and GUI. Solve ordinary differential equations with customizable inputs for initial conditions, step size, and time range. 


This repository contains my implementation of the forward Euler method, including a CLI and a GUI. These programs allow users to solve ordinary differential equations using the forward Euler method, with customizable inputs for initial conditions, step size, and time range.

#Usage

To use the program, simply launch the CLI/GUI from the command line. The program will prompt you for the necessary input parameters to solve the ODE using the forward Euler method. You can also use the GUI to enter the parameters using a graphical interface.
